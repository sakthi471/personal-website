                <h2>My First Failure</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Hey guys I am happy to say that I have got my first failure. I have failed in getting an internship in more than 3 companies. But I am happy, do you know why? One company in the list have responded me back with a suggestion to get improved. They have written in the mail that I have a lack of 4 qualities, First is insufficient skills to get into the intern. I know that I am interested in exploring many domains but I lack to complete any domain completely. This is the main reason for the lack of skill set in me. I think that I need to improve myself by getting at least a minimum of an intermediate level in learning anything I started. Next is My Resume was not too good, It didn't have everything I need to convey to the HR, thus I need to improve my resume, And while building the resume I have noticed that I have lack of projects and experience. Thus I have decided to do as many as projects next. Then comes the lack of communication skills. This is a major problem with everyone. Actually My Mother tongue is Tamil thus I am little bit poor in English. I have less proper communication skills, thus I have decided to do blog writing as well as Youtube to improve my communication skills. And the last is competition. We know that many people will be competing for this internship offer. This is a common failure for many people. Many of them loose their hope at this time. But I am believing myself and decided to try more and more as possible I could. Thanking for the company who sent this mail to improve myself. It broke my over confidence and made a path to me for success.</p>
